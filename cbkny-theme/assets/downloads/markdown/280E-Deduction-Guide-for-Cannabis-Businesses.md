## Understanding Section 280E

Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits businesses engaged in trafficking controlled substances from deducting most business expenses. This federal law significantly impacts cannabis businesses, even in states where cannabis is legal.

### üéØ Key Impact of 280E

- ‚úÖ Cannabis businesses can only deduct **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
- ‚ùå Most traditional business deductions are **prohibited**
- üìä Effective tax rates can reach **70% or higher**
- üõ°Ô∏è Proper planning and compliance are **essential**

### Why 280E Exists

Originally enacted in 1982 to prevent drug dealers from claiming business deductions, 280E now applies to all businesses trafficking in controlled substances - including state-legal cannabis operations.

## Compliance Strategies

### 1. üè¢ Separate Business Entities

Consider operating separate entities for different business activities:

**Plant-Touching Entity** (Subject to 280E)
- Handles cultivation, processing, manufacturing
- Can only deduct COGS
- Bears the 280E tax burden

**Management Company** (Not Subject to 280E)
- Handles administration, marketing, consulting
- Can deduct normal business expenses
- Charges management fees to plant-touching entity

**Real Estate Entity**
- Owns facilities and equipment
- Charges rent to operating entities
- Not subject to 280E restrictions

### 2. üìä Maximize COGS

#### ‚úÖ COGS Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Include all direct materials in COGS calculation
- [ ] Track direct labor hours and costs accurately
- [ ] Allocate facility costs to production activities
- [ ] Include equipment depreciation in COGS
- [ ] Document all COGS calculations thoroughly
- [ ] Use proper inventory accounting methods
- [ ] Include transportation and testing costs
- [ ] Allocate utilities to production areas

#### COGS Calculation Methods

**Specific Identification**
- Track individual product costs
- Best for small batches or unique products

**FIFO (First In, First Out)**
- Assume oldest inventory is sold first
- Good for products with expiration dates

**LIFO (Last In, First Out)**
- Assume newest inventory is sold first
- Can provide tax advantages in inflationary periods

**Weighted Average**
- Calculate average cost per unit
- Simplest method for similar products

### 3. üìù Maintain Detailed Records

280E compliance requires meticulous documentation:

#### Essential Documentation
- Detailed expense receipts and invoices
- Time tracking for all employees (production vs. admin)
- Inventory movement and tracking records
- COGS calculation worksheets and methods
- Bank statements and cash transaction logs
- Vendor contracts and service agreements
- Facility usage logs (production vs. administrative space)
